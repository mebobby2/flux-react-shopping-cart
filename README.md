# Learning Flux and React

## Development
- Run *npm install*
- Run *npm start&*. This starts up watchify. Watchify is a npm module that watches for changes in your js files and re-runs browserify. Browserify allows us to use node.js style modules in the browser. We define dependencies (through require()) and then browserify bundles it all up into a single neat and tidy JavaScript file.
